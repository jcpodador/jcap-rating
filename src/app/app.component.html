          <h3>Bongbong Marcos</h3>
          <p>By January 2020, Marcos confirmed that he is running "for a national position" in 2022, although he did not specify which position.[28] By September 2020, Marcos's sister Imee said that her brother was still noncommittal to which position he'd run for.[29] A year later, Marcos himself confirmed that "The presidency is not taken off the table."[30] On September 21, the Partido Federal ng Pilipinas (PFP; transl. Federal Party of the Philippines) nominated Marcos to run for president. If Marcos accepts, he will be inducted as a member of the party and be made its chairman.[31] During the national convention of the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL; transl. New Society Movement) in Binangonan, the party founded by his father, he was nominated as the party's candidate for president. Marcos, who remained a member of the Nacionalista Party, thanked KBL for the nomination, but said that he will announce his plans "when the time comes."[32] On October 5, Marcos announced his presidential candidacy.[33] Marcos then resigned from the Nacionalistas and was sworn in at the PFP chairman.[34] Marcos ultimately filed his presidential candidacy under the PFP.[35]</p>
